# Insurance-Claim
I analyzed a vehicle insurance claim dataset using Excel to understand claim patterns, fraud cases, accident locations, and policy types. I cleaned the data, explored key drivers of claims, and built a dashboard that highlighted risks, high claim categories, and fraud indicators.

## Project Objectives
• Identify total valid claims and fraud claims.

• Compare claim patterns by vehicle category.

• Review accident distribution across rural and urban areas.

• Analyze claims by fault type.

• Track claim frequency by car model, year, and month.

• Support fraud detection and policy decisions.

## Tools Used
• Excel for cleaning and transformation

• Excel formulas for analysis

• Pivot Tables for aggregation

• Excel charts for dashboard design

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
I cleaned the dataset using a simple and direct process. I checked for missing values to avoid gaps in the analysis. I fixed inconsistent entries to maintain uniformity across fields. I standardized values for vehicle type, policy type, and accident area to prevent grouping errors. I removed duplicates to avoid inflating claim totals. I converted the date fields into the correct format for accurate year and month breakdowns. I created new fields to summarize claim counts and fault categories used in the final dashboard.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

• Valid and fraud claim patterns

• Claims by vehicle category

• Claims by accident area

• Claims by fault

• Claims by car type

• Claims by policy type

• Claims by year

• Claims by month

## Major Insights
• Total valid claims were 14,208 and total fraud claims were 892.

• Utility vehicles recorded the highest number of claims with 9,510 cases.

• Urban areas accounted for 13,554 claims which was far higher than rural areas.

• Third party faults had the highest claim count with 10,952 cases.

• Toyota, Honda, and Ford recorded the highest claim volumes among car models.

• Liability policies recorded the highest number of claims across all years.

## Recommendations
• Focus fraud detection efforts on high claim vehicle categories.

• Strengthen controls for urban accident zones due to high volume.

• Review third party claim processes to reduce claim frequency.

• Adjust premiums for car models with consistently high claim rates.

• Improve policy design in liability categories to reduce exposure.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlighted the structure of claim volumes across multiple factors. The dashboard showed how vehicle type, accident location, fault source, and car model influenced the frequency of claims. It also exposed areas with high fraud activity, which can help insurance teams strengthen investigation processes. These insights support better policy pricing, risk management decisions, and fraud prevention strategies.
